# Quest Network
> Cross-Platform Trustless Social Network

![Screenshot](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qd-messages-ts/raw/0.9.3/doc/images/0.9.3.png?raw=true)

We are using qDesk as an example application for our JavaScript p2p library [Quest OS](quest-os-js) with cool open source modules like [qDesk Messages](qd-messages-ts) and [qDesk Social](qd-social-ts), as well as the upcoming [qDesk Markets](qd-market-ts), [qDesk News](qd-news-ts) and [qDesk Games](qd-games-ts).

We have chosen Angular/Electron as an example environment because we believe it offers the best accessibility for developers coming from any other language/framework. It is already being used in Python on PyQt5 and we aim to provide the underlying library in Go and wherever possible in Rust as well.

qDesk makes it possible to build custom, secure and decentralized social networks in less than 20 days.

0.9.5+ allow to connect qDesk Social profiles to Twitter without sharing information with Twitter as an additional layer of verification. It is planned to add passive verification for a custom list of external networks to verify the peer identities.

1.0.0+ complies with privacy regulations and can be used for confidential information as a production social network for enterprises worldwide.

This app is built on [Quest OS](quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io) and [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/).

Look what other people have built with qDesk: [Awesome Quest Network dApps](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/awesome/blob/master/README.md)!

qDesk allows to lazy load modules.
