We are using [qDesk](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/qDesk) as an example application for our JavaScript p2p library [Quest OS](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/quest-os-js) with cool open source modules like  [qD Messages](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/qd-messages-ts) and [qD Social](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/qd-social-ts), as well as the upcoming  [qD Markets](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/qd-market-ts), [qD News](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/qd-news-ts) and [qD Games](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/qd-games-ts).

We have chosen Angular/Electron as an example environment because we believe it offers the best accessibility for developers coming from any other language/framework. It is already being used in Python on PyQt5 and we aim to provide the underlying library in Go and wherever possible in Rust as well.

[qDesk](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/qDesk) makes it possible to build custom, secure and decentralized social networks in less than 20 days.

0.9.5+ allow to connect [qDesk](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/qDesk) Social profiles to Twitter without sharing information with Twitter as an additional layer of verification. It is planned to add passive verification for a custom list of external networks to verify the peer identities.

1.0.0+ complies with privacy regulations and can be used for confidential information as a production social network for enterprises worldwide.

This app is built on [Quest OS](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io) and [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/).

Look what other people have built with qDesk: [Awesome Quest Network dApps](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/awesome/blob/master/README.md)!

 [qDesk](https://questnetwork.github.io/docs/#/qDesk) allows to lazy load modules.
