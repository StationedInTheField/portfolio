# qDesk Markets

# Description

qDesk Market is a module for [qDesk](https://qDesk.org). It's accessible across qDesk, you can use it with qDesk Messages, qDesk Social and other qDesk modules. This module allows peers on the network to exchange physical goods, virtual goods and allows the scheduled booking of services.

It's not all qDesk though, qDesk Social is a protocol as well and if you are using [Quest OS](quest-os-js) in your applications, you can even use the underlying channels and data in your own application by booting with [Quest Social JS](quest-social-js).

qDesk Market offers the ability to offer your products and services commission free on a local and global level. You can have several stores, stores can be set to private or linked to a social profile. qDesk Market is a module for [qDesk](qDesk) and it's built on [Quest OS](quest-os-js) which makes use of the [Interplanetary Filesystem](https://ipfs.io), [IPFS GossipSub](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-05-20-gossipsub-v1.1/) and [qDesk](qDesk), our example app based on [Angular10](https://angular.io/).

We have chosen Angular/Electron as an example environment because we believe it offers the best accessibility for developers coming from any other language/framework. It is already being used in Python on PyQt5 and we aim to provide the underlying library in Go and wherever possible in Rust as well.

[qDesk](qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.
